CholoSave Security Measures by Breach Quadrilateral

Infiltration

- Password Hashing - Use bcrypt or Argon2 to store passwords securely.
- Rate Limiting for Login Attempts - Protect against brute-force login attacks.
- 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) - Add OTP verification for sensitive logins/actions.
- CAPTCHA on Forms - Stop bots from accessing login and signup.

Propagation

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Define clear permissions for users/admins.
- Group-Based Access Control - Ensure group data is isolated from other groups.
- Secure API Authorization - Use tokens (like Laravel Sanctum or Passport).
- Session Management - Regenerate session IDs, auto-expire inactive sessions.

Aggregation

- Input Validation & Sanitization - Stop SQL injection and XSS attempts.
- Authorization Checks on Data Access - Revalidate ownership before query execution.
- Admin Logs - Track sensitive operations like fund approval or role changes.
- Fraud Detection Alerts - Detect abnormal transaction behaviors or access patterns.

Exfiltration

- Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest - Use encryption for stored emergency fund, investment data.
- HTTPS Only (SSL/TLS) - Prevent sniffing or MITM attacks during data transmission.
- User Activity Logs - Log user actions to detect and investigate data leaks.
- Email/SMS Alerts - Notify users/admins of critical events like withdrawal or logins
